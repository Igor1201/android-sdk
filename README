These are the Android SDK source files downloaded by Android Studio,
augmented with a few packages selectively copied from the Android
source repositories hosted at https://android.googlesource.com. The
supplementing is necessary because some classes in the `android.jar`
are not present in the source files downloaded by `sdkmanager`.
